# smart delivery assist
The project for assistance of people during outbreak

Problem statement:
Delivery assist - now a days many people are struggling due to covid 19 
and they are enforced to be as quarantine to stay safe but in this case 
they're unable to get the necessary groceries and food with ease for their 
survive and for that reason government has stepped into home delivery using 
municipality work people's But here they are sacrificing their lives for our 
survival.

To overcome this issue we have designed a smart copter ,the
design and working process is as follows;

ABSTRACT:

      Drone Delivery system will track live location of consumer and 
hence provide assured delivery of package to the 
correct place and correct person. GPS Drone delivery system will 
locate the consumer through GPS and detect the live location and 
deliver the package accurately and within a stipulated time as 
per the date of delivery.GPS will be inbuilt in the drone and live 
tracking device will detect the location of users device which will 
currently be handled by the customer using OTP provided 
during generation of package to avoid fraud. There will be a 
main warehouse and some sub-warehouses, the drone will pick 
up the package from the nearest warehouse of the delivery 
location. It will behave like any home delivery app where both 
the customer and the dispatcher will be able to trace the 
live location. For tat case the users of this application
Have to scan the QR code for the recognition of the
Particular family which is then linked to the government 
maintenance site to view the orders done by the family...In the 
Same application secured payment gateway also set up to get paid
For their corresponding orders.
